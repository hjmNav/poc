Separate data and behaviour, having algebraic data types on one side and functions over them on the other.

### Algebraic data types
A kind of composite type. Two common types are product types (tuples, records) and sum types (tagged, disjoint unions,
coproduct, variant types). In kotlin, use: **sealed classes**

### Extra:

- Functions are first class citizens
- High Order Functions
- Pure functions and Referential Transparency
- Recursion
- Non-strict Evaluation
- Algebraic Data Types
- Immutability
- Side effects
- Declarative Programming
- Currying and Partial Application
